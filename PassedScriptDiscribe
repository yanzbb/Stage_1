Reasons for inviting LTE inside C2C connection:
   Cost;
   High compacity;
   

1. For Flow Moniter:
   Reasons for packet drop: https://www.nsnam.org/doxygen/group__flow-monitor.html#gac81e6b10f93e4d47d440d1df59b1e6b1
   Overall for packet drop the reason is varies, for eg TTL,missing route,check sum exceed, queuing overflow;
   Reasosn for packet loss: in script caculate the last seen time, if the delay is overexceeded, then stop tracking, added as lost packet;
   
2. Problematic with randomness of seed
   Reference web: https://www.nsnam.org/doxygen/group__randomvariable.html#details
   This is rediculous that for the freaking fact no randomness is added to the script USLESS I added them myself
