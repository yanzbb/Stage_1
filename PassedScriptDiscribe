Reasons for inviting LTE inside C2C connection:
   Cost;
   High compacity;
   Bandwidth exceeding;
   

1. For Flow Moniter:
   Reasons for packet drop: https://www.nsnam.org/doxygen/group__flow-monitor.html#gac81e6b10f93e4d47d440d1df59b1e6b1
   Overall for packet drop the reason is varies, for eg TTL,missing route,check sum exceed, queuing overflow;
   Reasosn for packet loss: in script caculate the last seen time, if the delay is overexceeded, then stop tracking, added as lost packet;
   Floz moniter file is reable by NetAnim as well... next step
   
2. Problematic with randomness of seed
   Reference web: https://www.nsnam.org/doxygen/group__randomvariable.html#details
   No randomness is added to the script
   
3. udp client & server
   Client & Server actually all installation of application; just being percise for the name
   Udp Client : Sends UDP packet carrying sequence number and time stamp in their payloads.
   Udp Server : A UDP server, receives UDP packets from a remote host. UDP packets carry a 32bits sequence number followed by a 64bits time stamp in their payloads. The application uses the sequence number to determine if a packet is lost, and the time stamp to compute the delay.
   Application & Socket : Conceptually, an application has zero or more ns3::Socket objects associated with it, that are created using the Socket creation API of the Kernel capability. 
   A socket is an abstract representation (handle) for the local endpoint of a network communication path.

4. For Scenario Background Setting
   1) create extra file as input configuration; then follow the command line here(https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/lte-user.html#configuration-of-lte-model-parameters)
   *./waf --command-template="%s --ns3::ConfigStore::Filename=input-defaults.txt --ns3::ConfigStore::Mode=Load --ns3::ConfigStore::FileFormat=RawText" --run src/lte/examples/lte-sim-with-input
   2) Setting inside script; according to test7.24.cc file
   3)
